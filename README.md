# EucsDroughtTraitsCoordination
Mapping functional, life-history traits and environmental variables related to drought tolerance and exposure in Box/Ironbarks and Redgum species

## Coordination of species-level traits:

Plant response to drought involves traits at a range of biological scale. The coordination of those traits and their association with environmental variables make it difficult to predict eucalyptus species drought tolerance.
Whole-plant responses involved a list of traits (see below)
 * Comparison of delta(13)C
 
 Available species-level functional traits:
  * delta(13)C
  * total carbon content
  * total nitrogen content
  * SLA
  * Wood density
  
Plant life-history traits:
  * maximum height
  * bark type (see differences on Euclid ID key)
  * resprouting strategy
  
Environmental/biome variables:
  * MAP
  * MAT
  * VPD
  * AI
  *
  
Trait association to test and plot:
 * d13C against latitude/MAP/MAT/AI/rainfall
 * d13C against SLA/WD/totalC/totalN

PCA and see if species regroup by taxonomic relationship/drought incicence in the environment

Linear mixed effect model to look at the significance of traits association at the species-level, with three replicated per species. Look at the standard deviation to see if reliable or not...
